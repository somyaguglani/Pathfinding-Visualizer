## PATHFINDING VISUALIZER ##

Welcome to the Pathfinding Visualizer ! I built this application because algorithms fascinate me a lot and by visualizing them
i could show everyone how they work behind the scenes . So here it is ! i hope you have as much fun using it as i had building it .
You can check it here https://somyaguglani.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/.

### Features ###

The application also allows features such as 

* Changing the speed at which the algorithms work .

* Recomputing the path instantly if start or target nodes are moved .

* Generating Mazes .

* Responsive 


### Meet The Algorithms ###

The application supports the following algorithms:


#### A* algorithm(weighted) : It is an algorithm that guarantees the shortest paths and takes decisions based on heuristics .

#### Dijkstra's algorithm(weighted)  : It is an algorithm that guarantees the shortest paths and is the father of all algorithms .

#### Greedy Best-first Search (weighted) : A faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A*; does not guarantee the shortest path.
 
#### Breadth First Search(unweighted): It is an algorithm that guarantees the shortest paths and is a great algorithm .

#### Depth First Search(unweighted) : It is a very slow algorithm that does not guarantees the shortest path .
